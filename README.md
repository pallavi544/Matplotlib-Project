# Matplotlib-Project
About the Project
This project demonstrates the use of Matplotlib, a core Python visualization library, for creating a variety of data visualizations. It includes examples of common plot types and shows how to customize them using labels, legends, colors, and figure styles. The notebook serves as a beginner-friendly introduction to visual storytelling through code.

## Objectives

*Practice using Matplotlib's pyplot interface

*Generate clear and meaningful visualizations

*Apply customization options for professional-quality plots

*Understand how visuals aid in interpreting data patterns

## Visuals Covered

*Line Plot

*Bar Chart

*Pie Chart

*Scatter Plot

*Histogram

Each plot is designed to help users understand the purpose and structure of visual representation in Python.

## Technologies Used:

*Python	              Programming language

*Matplotlib	          Visualization library

*Jupyter Notebook   	Interactive development environment
