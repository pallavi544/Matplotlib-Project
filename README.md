# Matplotlib-Project
This project is a Jupyter Notebook exported as an HTML file that showcases data visualization using Matplotlib, one of the most widely used plotting libraries in Python. The project is designed to display data-driven insights through clear, well-labeled charts and plots — all viewable directly in a web browser without needing to run any code.

By exporting the notebook to HTML (Project 1 (1) (1).html), it makes the content easy to share, view, and preserve, maintaining the structure, styling, code snippets, and output visuals in one interactive document.

**Objective

The aim of this project is to:

Demonstrate basic to intermediate proficiency in data visualization using Python

Convert a Jupyter Notebook into a standalone web-readable report

Explore a dataset and communicate findings visually using bar plots, line graphs, scatter plots, histograms, etc.

Practice creating clear, labeled, and styled plots using matplotlib’s API

**Key Features
* Code + Output in One File: Includes both the Python code and the corresponding visual output.

* Matplotlib Visualizations: Graphs like line charts, bar charts, scatter plots, or pie charts rendered with matplotlib.

* Jupyter Styling: Retains JupyterLab’s formatting and syntax highlighting.

* Self-Contained File: Viewable in any web browser — no need to install Python or open Jupyter.

* Interactive Layout: Easy navigation through sections using scrolling; visually segmented blocks for code and results.

**Technologies UsedTool/Library	Purpose:

Python :	Programming language used to process data and create plots
Jupyter Notebook :	Development environment for combining code, output, and markdown
Matplotlib	: Library used to generate high-quality, customizable visualizations
HTML/CSS :	Output format for web-based viewing; auto-generated by the notebook exporter

**Learning Outcomes
* By completing this project, the experience gained are:

* Designing visualizations that communicate data insights effectively

* Working with matplotlib’s object-oriented interface and pyplot

* Structuring a notebook for clarity and communication

* Exporting notebooks to shareable formats like HTML

* Building a portfolio piece that showcases data analysis and coding skills
